# The-Inverter
This project constructs a synthetic genetic inverter by reconfiguring a basic inducible expression system into a circuit that performs the logical operation Z = NOT(A) within a cell. The design retains the IPTG-responsive lac promoter as the digital input. It introduces a second promoter that drives the TetR repressor to invert the transcriptional output, resulting in high reporter expression when the input signal is absent and repression when it is present. Using Python-based DNA design tools, the workflow identifies the necessary regulatory parts, assembles them into a full linear DNA fragment, and simulates Gibson Assembly computationally with PyDNA to generate a complete plasmid-ready construct. This demonstrates how fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms (such as repression, induction, and promoter–repressor interactions) can be modularly combined to engineer programmable logic behaviour in living systems.
